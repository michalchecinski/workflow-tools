# Title: Prefixed Filename List (pfl)
# Description: This is a stub for a command that creates new files with prefix to keep them sorted by name in
#              chronological order by time
#     



echo "pfl - no yet implemented"

echo "
Ideas:
  - Use a .pfl-index file to track file prefix for incrementation
    + a .pfl-index file should exist in all directories that pfl works in
    + \`pfl init\` initializes the directory with the .pfl-index file
  - \`pfl new <filename>\` auto increments the prefix and opens the file in $EDITOR
