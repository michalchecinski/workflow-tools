# Workflow Tools and Configs

This is a collection of tools and configs to ease my devlopment workflow and/or
my tech workflow.

**0. bin** - A collection of useful scripts

- dotfiles

**1. docker** - I have a dream of being computer agnostic when it comes to my
development environment. I switch between multiple computers on a weekly basis; 
a powerful workstation with multiple monitors at home or work and a thin sleek
long-battery-life laptop on the move. I would like to seemlessly switch between
these and any other computers that I would like. I currently have two ideas on 
how to make this a reality. The first is using a cloud based VM (which I am 
essentially doing the same thing now with a local server) which could have a 
suite of tools surrounding it to minimize cost (I don't develop while I sleep. 
Why should I pay for that compute time?). However, with the adoption of 
containerization, anything that can be run in a VM can be run in a container. 
I'm not sure if docker is the right tool with the decision to design their 
containers around a single process, but this is the current attempt using 
docker. I have not adopted it fully as it still has some work that needs to be 
done (Do I use dind to control the local docker instance from inside the DevEnv 
container? If not set up correctly, does this lead to a security risk? Am I ok 
with the security risk? Will I be using this in an environment that cannot have 
security risks?). Maybe LXD is the way to go? This should be compatible with all
Linux computers/servers (maybe even chromebooks some day?).

Cloud based VM:
- Could provide a powerful computer environment for a thin not-powerful laptop
- Always needs to be connected to the internet
- Could experience connection lag depending on local network (coffee shop)
- Security concerns connecting from public networks (solution: VPN, but lag)

Container:
- Theoretically, performance grows with the machine it is on if resources are
not limited by the orchestrator.
- Theoretically does everything a VM does with less overhead
- Decouples DevEnv from the internet if desired

Thoughts: Create a LXD container with vim and tmuxp as the dev environment that
connects to a remote docker cluster (swarm or machine?) to run any other 
development containers (ex. run a python container on the docker cluster if
developing in python and run the scripts in the container. Could use aliases if
absolutely necessary for faster program execution `dpython3 hello.py` instead of 
`docker run --rm -it python:3.7.5-slim-buster python hello.py`)

**2. .tmuxp** - I have always been interested in aliases for different tasks that
I do a lot. However, early on in my career, aliases were one of factors in me
deleting a website from production. Since then, they have left a bad taste in my
mouth. Recently I have wanted to have directory specific aliases so that there 
would be protection against running commands on a global scale. The 
[funky](https://github.com/bbugyi200/funky) project could be a good way to do so,
however, I am not sold on the idea as of yet (maybe if I look into is more in the 
future). Really, with my little knowledge of build systems, I may just be after a
language agnostic build system framework. I really don't know.

In light of this need, because I use tmuxp, I disovered a way to add in local 
aliases to the tmuxp sessions that I am using. This folder is the file structure
that I use to do so. 

Dependencies:
- tmux
- [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp)

To deploy, copy this .tmuxp folder into the project and add
the following to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` (change accordingly for other
shells):
```
function mtmx () {
  if [ $1 ]; then
    echo "params: $#"
    echo "file: $1"
  else
    tmuxp load .tmuxp/
  fi
}
```

Any shell script that is added to `.tmuxp/bin` will now be an executable in your
tmuxp session as long as it is an executable. Honestly, this is still a work in 
progress. I would like to make this more generic since it is currently very project 
specific. I will contiune to update it as a have more ideas.

#### Archive

**1. tmux** - I discovered tmux a couple of years ago and immediately 
incorporated it into my daily workflow. I was creating a bunch of SSH tunnels
to a single machine just to have the connections all crash for some reason and I
would lose all of my workspace setup. Using tmux that is built ontop of screen 
allows me to connect back to the server and reattach to the tmux session. It 
also allows me to multitask on the server which is very helpful when developing
with docker and I want to see the system resource utilization (some docker 
containers can be memory hogs), all of the current docker containers, as well as
the code editor and some other random shells. 

**2. tmuxp** - I found that writing a bunch of bash to get a specific layout that 
would change with screen size was pretty annoying especially when I had to go
and guess what size the panes were. I was going to write my own python wrapper
for the bash tmux, but I used one of the most important lessons that I have 
learned as a junior developer: "Don't reinvent the wheel if you don't have to or
you really aren't looking to learn from doing so." I found 
[tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) when searching for that wheel and
it fits perfectly into my workflow. I am now aware of tmuxinator that looks
about the same as tmuxp; however, I am partial to python and tools written in 
python and because python is found already installed on most *NIX servers (not that
you couldn't install Ruby, but less hassle and mess?).

#### Future Work

I am still looking for that perfect computer-agnostic development environment 
that is hopefully decoupled from the internet (or at least can be). As much as
I would like to use containers, I still have not settled on the best design and
will probably get a cloud-based VM up and running. The thought here is that
development is normally tightly coupled with the internet (I constantly search 
for answers to questions).

Update [2021-08-15]: Codespaces looks interesting.
